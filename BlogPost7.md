Today, I was trying to debug the errors in the AR project, by making some changes in the build and player settings, as well as adding a new GameObject called DestinationManager to make the destination buttons functional. 
I integrated QR code scanning with QRScanner to decode QR codes and dynamically set start positions in the ARPathfinding script, alongside implementing the CaptureCameraImage function to utilize the AR camera feed for QR code scanning. 
I also assigned the destination buttons and transforms in the DestinationManager script to handle navigation to various destinations. 
As for the VR project, I have added a sand castle as an object on the beach. I have also added banana and fish prefabs to the scene and made them interactable (the user can pick them up and throw them away).
