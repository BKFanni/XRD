<h1>AR Navigation Mobile Application for VIA University College</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The AR Navigation Mobile Application was developed as part of an innovative project aimed at improving navigation within the campus of VIA University College. Recognizing the challenges faced by students, visitors, and staff in locating facilities such as the canteen, elevators, and reception, the team designed an AR-based solution to provide a seamless and user-friendly navigation experience. Due to time-constraints, the developers focused on implementing the project for the 1st floor of the Campus, not the whole building.

<h2>Purpose and Value</h2>
The application addresses a common issue faced by newcomers and regular users of the campus: difficulty in finding facilities within a complex building layout. By leveraging AR technology, this application simplifies navigation and enhances the overall user experience, making it particularly useful during busy periods such as enrollment days, events, or exams.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>1. QR Code Location Determination:</h3>
   Upon launching the application, users are prompted to scan a QR code located at strategic points on the first floor. This step establishes the user’s starting location, ensuring accurate navigation.

<h3>2. Destination Selection:</h3>
   The application provides a straightforward interface where users can choose from a list of predefined destinations, including the canteen, elevators, and reception.

<h3>3. Interactive AR Navigation:  </h3>
   After selecting a destination, the application overlays directional lines onto the user's real-world view, guiding them step-by-step to their desired location.

<h3>4. Integration with Building Plan:</h3>
   The navigation logic is built on the university’s official building plan, ensuring accurate and reliable directions.

<h2>Development Process</h2>
The application was developed in Unity, leveraging AR Foundation for its augmented reality capabilities. Key steps in the development process included:

- <h3>Building Plan Utilization:</h3>
  The official building layout was digitized and integrated into the app to ensure precise mapping and navigation.

- <h3>QR Code Implementation:</h3>
  QR codes were strategically placed at multiple points on the first floor. Using Unity’s capabilities, the application detects these codes and uses their data to set the user's current location.

- <h3>Destination Mapping and Pathfinding:</h3>
  Paths to each destination were defined using the building layout, and AR-based visual guides were created to display these routes in real-time.

- <h3>User Interface Design:</h3>
  A simple, intuitive interface was designed to ensure ease of use, even for individuals unfamiliar with AR technology.

<h2>Impact and Usability</h2>
The application was tested within the university to ensure accuracy and usability. It proved effective in helping users navigate the first floor with minimal effort. By reducing the time spent searching for facilities, the app enhances the overall campus experience and demonstrates the potential of AR technology in practical, everyday scenarios.

<h2>Future Enhancements </h2>
To further improve the application, future developments could include:  
- Adding support for more floors and facilities.  
- Expanding the destination list to include classrooms and other important locations.  
- Implementing voice-guided navigation for accessibility.  
- Providing real-time updates for temporary changes, such as closed areas or event-specific adjustments.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This AR navigation application showcases the power of augmented reality in solving real-world challenges. By improving accessibility and reducing confusion on campus, it has the potential to become an indispensable tool for students, staff, and visitors alike. This project reflects the team's dedication to innovation and the practical application of AR technology.
