<p>The XR course has been an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to contribute to two exciting projects: the AR Navigation Mobile Application and the VR Meditation Space. These projects helped me enhance my technical skills, collaborate effectively with my team, and deepen my understanding of immersive technologies.

In the AR Navigation Mobile Application, I played a key role in integrating AR markers to guide users to various campus facilities, such as the canteen and reception. My focus was on ensuring accurate alignment between virtual markers and the physical space, and designing an intuitive user interface. Given the project’s scope, we focused on the first floor of the campus, which required thoughtful planning to deliver a functional prototype within the time constraints. This experience taught me how to balance technical execution with user-friendly design.

The VR Meditation Space was a more immersive project, aiming to create a calming virtual environment. I worked on setting up the XR Rig for room-scale tracking, ensuring users could naturally explore the space. I also integrated looping sound effects, like ocean waves, and fine-tuned the 3D audio to enhance the immersive experience. Additionally, I developed interactive elements such as throwable objects, enabling users to engage with their surroundings in a relaxed, playful way. This project gave me experience in both creating immersive environments and implementing realistic interactions within them.

Reflecting on these projects, I’m proud of the skills I’ve developed in Unity, C#, and XR tools. I’ve learned how to design with a focus on the user’s experience and how to solve technical challenges in creative ways. These projects have inspired me to continue exploring XR’s potential, and I look forward to applying what I’ve learned to future projects in education, healthcare, and entertainment. </p>
