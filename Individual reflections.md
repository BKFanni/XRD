<p>The XR course has been a truly transformative experience for me, especially as someone who had no prior experience in XR development. While I was already familiar with Unity from a game development course I took last semester, diving into AR and VR projects was completely new for me. Through this course, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting projects: an AR Navigation Mobile Application and a VR Meditation Space. Both challenged me to expand my technical skills, collaborate with a team, and explore creative uses of XR technology.

For the AR Navigation Mobile Application, I focused on setting up AR markers to guide users to locations like the canteen and reception. Using Unity’s AR Foundation, I enabled ARCore support and implemented AR Sessions for accurate tracking. I also designed a simple user interface to help users select destinations and navigate seamlessly. The project required careful planning to deliver a functional prototype of the campus’s first floor within the time limits, teaching me how to balance technical work with user-friendly design.

The VR Meditation Space project involved creating a relaxing virtual environment. I set up an XR Rig for room-scale tracking and added calming elements like ambient ocean sounds and 3D audio for a more engaging experience. I also incorporated interactive features, such as throwable objects, to make the space playful and soothing. This project helped me understand how to design engaging virtual spaces and implement natural interactions for users.

Looking back, I’m proud of how much I’ve learned and grown as a developer. These projects sharpened my skills in Unity, C#, and XR tools, while also deepening my understanding of user experience design. The course has inspired me to explore XR’s potential further and apply it to areas like education, healthcare, and entertainment. </p>
