<p>The XR course has been a truly transformative experience for me, especially as someone who had no prior experience in XR development. While I was already familiar with Unity from a game development course I took last semester, diving into AR and VR projects was completely new for me. Through this course, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting projects: an AR Navigation Mobile Application and a VR Meditation Space. Both challenged me to expand my technical skills, collaborate with a team, and explore creative uses of XR technology.

For the AR Navigation Mobile Application, I focused on setting up AR markers to guide users to locations like the canteen and reception. Using Unity’s AR Foundation, I enabled ARCore support and implemented AR Sessions for accurate tracking. I also designed a simple user interface to help users select destinations and navigate seamlessly. The project required careful planning to deliver a functional prototype of the campus’s first floor within the time limits, teaching me how to balance technical work with user-friendly design.

The VR Meditation Space project involved creating a relaxing virtual environment. I set up an XR Rig for room-scale tracking and added calming elements like ambient ocean sounds and 3D audio for a more engaging experience. I also incorporated interactive features, such as throwable objects, to make the space playful and soothing. This project helped me understand how to design engaging virtual spaces and implement natural interactions for users.

Looking back, I’m proud of how much I’ve learned and grown as a developer. These projects sharpened my skills in Unity, C#, and XR tools, while also deepening my understanding of user experience design. The course has inspired me to explore XR’s potential further and apply it to areas like education, healthcare, and entertainment. </p>

<p> The XR course was a great experience for me, pushing me beyond my comfort zone and introducing me to the fascinating world of extended reality. It was my first time working with tools like Unity and Blender so coming from a background with zero experience i found it quite hard to get used to these new tools. The course not only strengthened my technical foundation but also inspired me to think creatively about how XR can solve real-world problems.

I had the chance to work on two very different projects: an AR Navigation Mobile Application and a VR Meditation Space. For the AR project, my primary focus was on creating a navigation system that could guide students to specific locations, such as the canteen or reception. I started by building a real-sized model of VIA's first floor in Blender and then created a NavMesh so we could later calculate the distance between waypoints.

On the VR Meditaion Space, my tasks were mainly focused on making the scenario. Using Unity's terrain functionality I built the island model. After that I searched for assets online to complete our scenario. These included water, trees and some rocks that ended up not being used. This project was the one I enjoyed working on the most and I believe that if we had a bit more time, we could have developed something of higher quality.

Overall, this course has been a defining chapter in my journey as a developer. Working on these projects gave me valuable hands-on experience with Unity, Blender and XR tools, while also teaching me how to approach user experience with empathy and creativity. Overall I am satisfied with my performance but I believe I still have quite a lot to learn, mostly in C# and certain Unity functionalities.

Throughout the XRD course, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting and challenging projects that pushed my skills and expanded my understanding of immersive technologies: an AR mobile application and a VR application. Both projects were developed using Unity, and each offered a unique set of learning experiences.

The AR mobile application aimed to assist new students and other visitors in navigating the 1st floor of our campus building. It provided a user-friendly interface to locate important points within the building, such as classrooms, offices, and facilities. Implementing AR features in Unity was initially a steep learning curve, especially when configuring the map-based selection interface and integrating AR functionalities. However, as I gained familiarity with the tools and frameworks, it became a rewarding experience to see the app come to life and provide a practical solution to a real-world problem.

The VR application, called "Meditation Space", was designed as a calming and immersive environment for mindfulness and relaxation. The project was particularly meaningful as it focused on promoting mental well-being. I enjoyed exploring creative ways to design the environment, such as adding dynamic lighting and interactable elements to enhance the overall experience. Using the XR Interaction Toolkit with OpenXR in Unity presented some initial challenges, but it also allowed me to delve deeper into VR development techniques and experiment with interaction mechanics.

Although both projects were challenging to implement as we faced some obstacles, it was a really fun and valuable experience. They tested my ability to problem-solve, adapt to new tools, and collaborate effectively. Through this course, I gained valuable hands-on experience with XRD technologies and a deeper appreciation for the potential of AR and VR to transform user experiences. I am excited to continue exploring AR and VR in future projects and to apply these skills in real-world contexts.
