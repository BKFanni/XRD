  <li>What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare? (Fanni)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>AR (Augmented Reailty)R: AR enhances the real world with digital overlays. The devices used for AR are typically smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses. AR is a part of XR and MR technologies.</li>
    <li>VR (Virtual Reailty): Virtual Reality fully immerses the user in a completely digital environment, replacing the real world with a simulated one. It provides a 360-degree view of the virtual world, often interactive. It requires VR headsets like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or PlayStation VR. VR is a component of XR but is distinct from AR and MR as it replaces reality rather than augmenting it.</li>
    <li>AV (Augmented Virtuality): Augmented Virtuality blends real-world objects into a predominantly virtual environment. Unlike AR, which adds digital content to the real world, AV adds elements of the physical world into a virtual space. VR headsets or other immersive systems with cameras are often used to integrate physical elements.</li>
    <li>MR (Mixed Reailty): Mixed Reality combines elements of both AR and VR. In MR, digital and real-world objects interact in real-time, allowing virtual elements to interact with the real world in a more integrated way. MR devices include HoloLens or Magic Leap, which allow digital objects to be anchored in and interact with the real world.</li>
    <li>XR (Extended Reailty): Extended Reality is an umbrella term that covers all immersive technologies, including AR, VR, MR, and any other future realities that combine the physical and digital worlds. XR encompasses all devices used for AR, VR, and MR experiences.</li>

  <li>How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications? Advantages/disadvantages? (Fanni)</li>
    <ul>
      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <li>Immersive Experience: XR provides a sense of presence, engaging users in ways traditional apps cannot.</li>
      <li>Enhanced Interactivity: Users can naturally interact with digital content through gestures and movements.</li>
      <li>Contextual Awareness: XR adapts to the real environment, overlaying relevant information.</li>
      <li>Effective Training: XR offers realistic simulations for risk-free skill practice, like medical training.</li>
      <li>Higher Engagement: XR's immersive nature leads to greater user interest and retention.</li>
      <br/>
      <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
      <li>Hardware Needs: Specialized equipment (e.g., VR headsets) can be costly and limit accessibility.</li>
      <li>Comfort Issues: Prolonged use can cause discomfort, such as motion sickness.</li>
      <li>Limited Portability: XR setups are less mobile, often requiring specific spaces.</li>
      <li>Complex Development: XR apps are more expensive and challenging to create than traditional ones.</li>
      <li>Adoption Barriers: XR has a steeper learning curve and slower user adoption.</li>
      <li>Performance Constraints: XR can drain battery life and cause overheating on mobile devices.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <li>What use cases does XR have? (Marwa)</li> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>Gaming and Entertainment: Creates immersive experiences, making games and media more engaging.</li>
<li>Education and Training: Provides safe, realistic simulations for complex skill development in fields like medicine and aviation.</li>
<li>Healthcare: Offers innovative treatment options and enhances medical training.</li>
<li>Retail and E-Commerce: Improves shopping experiences through virtual try-ons and product visualization.</li>
<li>Real Estate and Architecture: Facilitates virtual property walkthroughs and design visualization.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>How does XR add value to the end user? (Marwa) </li> 

<ul>
  <li>Enhancing Engagement: XR makes experiences like gaming, shopping, and learning much more immersive and exciting, drawing users deeper into the experience.</li>
  <li>Improving Skill Development: It creates safe, realistic environments where people can practice and learn without real-world risks, leading to better skills and confidence.</li>
  <li>Revolutionizing Education and Training: XR offers interactive, hands-on learning experiences that make education more engaging and effective, whether it's for students or professionals.</li>
  <li>Personalizing Experiences: XR tailors interactions to fit individual needs, like letting you try on clothes virtually or offering personalized therapy, making the experience more satisfying and relevant.</li>
  <li>Increasing Convenience: It brings complex activities, such as virtual shopping or exploring properties, right to your home, saving you time and effort.</li>
  <li>Innovating Treatment and Care: In healthcare, XR opens up new ways to treat patients and improve their well-being, offering more effective and engaging care options.</li>
</ul>

  <li>How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology? (Duarte)</li>
  <p>Current XR technology offers a sample of what is possible to do with this technology. It clearly remains behind the possible idealistic future but significant advancements are being made to close this gap. </p>
  <li>How does immersion and presence factor into XR? (Duarte)</li>
  <p>Immersion and presence are key to XR experiences. Immersion involves the feeling of being present inside the virtual environment through good visuals and sounds. Presence involves the feeling of existing inside that environment. Both immersion and presence are essential to make the XR experience feel more real. </p>
