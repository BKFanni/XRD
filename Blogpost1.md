  Compared to the common inputs of mouse, keyboard and controller buttons, the user mainly uses their body, rather than just fingers, to experience the XR. Some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Phones AR input - while AR achieved by phones is the closest to the "usual" non-XR inputs, it still requires the user to rotate around and move their body to interact (most often find) the AR objects. Sadly most of the interactions are still done by tapping on the screen.
      </li>
      <li>
      AR using a HMD (head mounted display) - AR using a HMD allows the user to use their body motion to rotate the camera and see the AR objects appear in the real world. The HMD often come with controllers, which can be used to interact with the AR objects - using both arm movement and finger keypress input.
      </li>
      <li>
      VR (using HMD) - Since both VR and "AR using a HMD" both have a HMD, their inputs are pretty much identical. The only difference is the environment that they're in - AR being a part of the real world and VR being the world.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>What problems can XR solve? (Andrejs)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
      In-person attendance - XR allows the user not to be in-person to help or work together with their colleagues and clients, as well as experience various events.
      </li>
      <li>
      Simulations and plans - with XR it is possible to digitally interact with and try out simulations (eg. surgeries) multiple times before executing it in the real world. It also allows users to plan and visually see how could a house or furniture look before comitting.
      </li>
      <li>
      Boredom - the entertainment industry greatly benefits from the extra immersion and additional ways to control your character provided by XR hardware.
      </li>
      <li>
      Visualization - with XR it is possible to bring the digital objects out of the 2D screens and into the 3rd dimension. This allows for easier and more intuitive interaction with the objects, as well as giving a better representation of how the object is supposed to look like (think of a globe).
      </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
