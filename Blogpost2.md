<h1>About the project</h1>
<h4>Fanni</h4>
<p>The project is going to be an AR mobile application designed to be used by students / people at VIA University College Campus Horsens. <br/>
  It will help people navigate inside the building, especially for newcomers, for example: where the canteen is located and show directions to get there.<br/>
  To minimize the scope of the project due to time limitation, we decided to make the project only for the groundfloor of the building.

<h2>Planning</h2>
<h4>Fanni</h4>
<p>First, Andrejs has made sure that we have the permission and floorplan from VIA. In the meantime, Marwa setup a basic AR project in Unity and Duarte looked into what technologies we could use for creating the project. After getting the floorplan, Duarte started on creating the 3D models of the building. <br/>
Next, we will identify and discuss the use cases and features that would be implemented and equally split the tasks between the group members.
