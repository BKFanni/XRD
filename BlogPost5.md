Project Title: VR Meditation Space - Beach Environment

Description: The project aims to create a peaceful, immersive VR beach environment where users can relax and meditate. The scene will feature calming visuals, such as a sandy shoreline, gentle ocean waves, and soft natural lighting to simulate a relaxing time of day. Ambient sounds, like waves and distant seagulls, and optional background music will enhance the soothing atmosphere. Subtle animations, such as flowing water and swaying palm trees, will further bring the environment to life.

First, we began with project planning, creating a detailed to-do list outlining all the tasks required to complete the project. This organized approach allowed us to break down the project into manageable steps and ensured we had a clear roadmap to guide our work.</p>

The initial setup for the project has been completed, establishing a stable foundation for VR development in Unity.
With Unity installed, I created a new project titled "Meditation Space" using the 3D template. This setup is essential for building an immersive VR environment, specifically a meditation-themed beach scene that will serve as the primary setting for the experience.

Next, I configured the VR SDK to support VR interactions. I accessed **Edit > Project Settings > XR Plugin Management** and enabled the **OpenXR** plugin, selected based on the target VR platform for compatibility across multiple VR headsets. Additionally, I imported the **XR Interaction Toolkit** from the Unity Package Manager. This toolkit simplifies the setup of interactive VR elements, providing pre-built components for VR controller input and spatial interactions.

With these initial steps completed, the project is now set up and ready for the development of VR interactions and immersive beach visuals.
