Project Title: VR Meditation Space - Beach Environment

Description: The project aims to create a peaceful, immersive VR beach environment where users can relax and meditate. The scene will feature calming visuals, such as a sandy shoreline, gentle ocean waves, and soft natural lighting to simulate a relaxing time of day. Ambient sounds, like waves and distant seagulls, and optional background music will enhance the soothing atmosphere. Subtle animations, such as flowing water and swaying palm trees, will further bring the environment to life.

First, we began with project planning, creating a detailed to-do list outlining all the tasks required to complete the project. This organized approach allowed us to break down the project into manageable steps and ensured we had a clear roadmap to guide our work.</p>

The initial setup for the project has been completed, establishing a stable foundation for VR development in Unity.
I created a new project titled "Meditation Space" using the VR template. This setup is essential for building an immersive VR environment, specifically a meditation-themed beach scene that will serve as the primary setting for the experience.

This template provides the setup for VR interactions and movement, including XR components like XR Origin and XR Interaction Manager. These components enable head and hand tracking and provide a base for developing VR experiences with room-scale movement or additional features like teleportation and interaction tools.

With these initial steps completed, the project is now set up and ready for the development of VR interactions and immersive beach visuals.

<p>To prepare our VR experience, I started by adding an XR Rig to our project. This rig will serve as the user’s VR camera and controllers, allowing interaction within the environment once the beach scene is complete. Although we haven’t yet positioned the rig within the scene, it’s ready to be set up when the environment is fully prepared.

For VR settings, I configured the project to use OpenXR as our target platform, ensuring compatibility across different VR devices. I enabled Virtual Reality Supported to let Unity recognize VR hardware, then set the Tracking Space to “Room Scale,” allowing users freedom to move around</p>
