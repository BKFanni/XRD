Project Title: VR Meditation Space - Beach Environment

Description: The project aims to create a peaceful, immersive VR beach environment where users can relax and meditate. The scene will feature calming visuals, such as a sandy shoreline, gentle ocean waves, and soft natural lighting to simulate a relaxing time of day. Ambient sounds, like waves and distant seagulls, and optional background music will enhance the soothing atmosphere. Subtle animations, such as flowing water and swaying palm trees, will further bring the environment to life.

First, we began with project planning, creating a detailed to-do list outlining all the tasks required to complete the project. This organized approach allowed us to break down the project into manageable steps and ensured we had a clear roadmap to guide our work.</p>
