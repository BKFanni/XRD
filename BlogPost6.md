<p>In this lab session, I tried to fix some of project errors, test the project, and connect it to the VR device with my other team members.
First, I downloaded the Android platform from the Build Settings to enable building the project for VR on Android devices. Then, I downloaded sound effects for gentle waves, and imported these files into Unityâ€™s Assets folder.

Next, I created an Audio Source component, attaching it to the XR Rig. I assigned the Waves Audio Clip to loop continuously and adjusted the volume and 3D sound settings for a gentle effect, creating a realistic, immersive sound experience as users move closer to the shore.</p>

I added a sunrise and sunset skybox in the lightning settings menu to the beach scene. Then I adjusted the directional light to create a more realistic atmosphere, to enhance the visual experience in the VR project.

In our second session we ran into some problems with the water asset, so I looked for a different asset to fix the issue. I also tested the app inside the oculus and tried working with meta quest link app but unfortunately, my laptop does not fit the requirements to use quest link.
I spent most of this session setting up a testing environment.
